# ðŸ“˜ Practice Progress Tracker

This repository is a detailed journal of my MERN Stack learning journey. It tracks every concept Iâ€™ve practiced â€” from front-end development in React.js to back-end logic using Node.js and Express.js. All topics are backed by live, coded repositories built by me.

Each repo listed below focuses on one or more core concepts. This tracker helps clients, recruiters, or collaborators quickly understand the depth and direction of my skillset.

## ðŸ“‚ My Core Practice Folder

> ðŸ”— [`react-masterFile-practice`](https://github.com/FaiziCodeSpace/react-masterFile-practice)

This repo contains all day-to-day React practice. I build everything here first, then move it into dedicated, topic-based repositories after polishing.

ðŸ“Œ Organized into folders like:
- `file-1` â†’ Props, input handling, form setup
- `file-2` â†’ State management, toggle logic, event flow
- `file-3` â†’ Styling: Internal, External, CSS Modules
- `file-4` â†’ Hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, useId, useFormState, useTransition, custom hooks
- `file-5` â†’ Array & Object rendering, fragments, derived state
- `file-6` â†’ React Router and navbar logic
- `contextAPI/` â†’ Global state with context
- `CustomHooks/` â†’ Reusable logic & showcases
- `router/` â†’ Layout-based routing & conditional navbar
- `file-7(API)/` â†’ Real and Mock API Fetching + loading state
  - ðŸ†• Loading GIF added using `useState` and `useEffect`
  - âž• Implemented through a feature branch (`feature-loading-gif`)

ðŸ†• **Latest Additions:**
- âœ… Integrated Dummy API using `fetch()` for user data
- âœ… Connected JSON Server for local API mocking
- âœ… Implemented loading spinner/message using state before API completes
- ðŸ†• Added GIF loader to simulate real-world loading experience
- âœ… Feature completed via separate branch + PR workflow
