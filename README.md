# ðŸ“˜ Practice Progress Tracker

This repository is a detailed journal of my MERN Stack learning journey. It tracks every concept Iâ€™ve practiced â€” from front-end development in React.js to back-end logic using Node.js and Express.js. All topics are backed by live, coded repositories built by me.

Each repo listed below focuses on one or more core concepts. This tracker helps clients, recruiters, or collaborators quickly understand the depth and direction of my skillset.

- `file-3` (styling practice)
- `file-4` (advanced hooks)
- `file-5` (arrays, objects, fragments)
- `contextAPI`, `CustomHooks`, `router` folders
